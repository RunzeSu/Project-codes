# Project-codes
We transfered the codes from DanQ into python3 while updating the related packages to the newest version. The old version could be found in: https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ

To run the model, tensorflow environment is needed. They used 60 epochs in DanQ while we used 50, and we changed the format of the dataset. To download the dataset, please refer to DeepSEA from:

I also attached the commands used to submit my job to MSU HPCC. For more details about MSU HPCC, please visit HPCC Wiki at: https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/
