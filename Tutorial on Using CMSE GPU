This is a breif tutorial to run python codes on HPCC GPU provided by Michigan State University. 

Before we utilization of HPCC GPU, we need to log into our account by typing ssh usersname@hpcc.msu.edu. To apply for an account, please 
visit https://contact.icer.msu.edu/account.

After logging into the account, there will be several nodes to choose, basically we choose intel-16-k80 by typing ssh intel-16-k80. Then write down an sbatch 
file because GPU only works for scheduling a job. Of course, MSU HPCC also provides CPU environment to run codes on CPU, and if we run 
codes on desktop, HPCC will use default CPU with limited memory and time (up to 2 hours). I posted the sbatch file for job submission, 
the default running time was set as 20 hours because each epoch would take about 13 minutes and we set the total epochs to be 60.
Besides, we can also change the number of GPUs and memory from the command. 

To submit the sbatch file, just type sbatch submission.sbatch and system will automatically put the job into a queue, 
on the desktop there will be an output telling us the job number. If the GPUs in the node is
not busy, the job will run at once. Outouts will be recorded automatically in a slurm file. However, the scheduling will send the job into 
the default Nvidia GPU, but if the node is busy, the submitted job will have to wait until its priority ranks the top. Of course, it is also possible 
to use the GPU provided by CMSE department if we are one
